Super Star Trek for TRS-80

This is a TRS-80 cassette image of Super Star Trek 
from the 1979 edition of “Basic Computer Games TRS-80 EDITION” by David H. Ahl

It is very similar to the Spacewar (By Mike Mayfield) that ran on the PDP 11 computer that I played on in school.

I tested it with the SDLTRS emulator

So...
1) Define it as a cassette in your TRS-80 emulator
2) Type CLOAD
3) Type RUN after the READY message
